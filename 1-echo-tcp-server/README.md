# 1 - Echo TCP Server

Write a TCP server that echoes whatever you write to it. Also write a
client that connects to this TCP server, writes `stdin` to the server,
then prints the reply to `stdout`.

## Example

Run `node server.js` and `node client.js` in different terminals, then
type a message into the client's terminal.
